# Fake News Detector
This project focuses on using Neural Networks (LSTM model) to create a fake news detector. Briefly, the algorithm's input would be a text document/article,
and the output would be a binary number of whether the news article is fake (0) or real (1).

The Data collected was 2 csv files, one for every type of news, and it was collected from the following Github repo: https://github.com/laxmimerit/fake-real-news-dataset

The next step in this project would be deploying the models to a web page that users could interact with and post news articles as input and receive a binary output.
