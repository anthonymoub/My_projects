    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Collagen diseases are a group of conditions that affect the connective tissues in the body, which provide structure and support to organs and tissues. These diseases can range from mild to severe and include conditions like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. In these diseases, thrombosis is one of the most important and severe complications, one of the major cause of death in collagen diseases. Recently, this complication is closely related with anti-cardiolipin antibodies, which was discovered by the medical physicians, one of whom donated the datasets for discovery challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seriousness of Thrombosis has made it one of the most important diseases being explored in the medical industry, for properly understanding it and potentially identifying its predictors would provide a breakthrough that made save thousands of lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, Georgetown University has provided me with data from their university hospital to conduct an analysis on thrombosis and its possible contributors. This data includes information on patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory results, which will be used to identify potential risk factors and underlying causes of thrombosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives of this project are: <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify potential predictors of Thrombosis.\n",
    "* Analyze any potential temporal patterns associated with Thrombosis.\n",
    "* Understand the characteristics of a patient with Thrombosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To achieve these objectives, the data will be carefully analyzed to identify any significant patterns and relationships that can provide insights into the causes and characteristics of Thrombosis. By doing so, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of Collagen diseases, particularly Thrombosis, and ultimately improve the diagnosis and treatment of these life-threatening conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hospital has provided with 3 main datasets, brief descriptions of each can be found below: <br><br>\n",

    "The heatmap above clearly highlights how none of the lab result variables are significantly correlated with whether or not a person has Thrombosis, making almost all the dataset irrelevant when it comes to further understanding the disease. The only variables that have some sort of correlation are acl_igg and ana (both in the 0.2-0.4 range), and both come from df_B, making the third dataset even more useless.\n",

    "# Technical Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "Suprisingly, the data provided for this analysis much lower in quality than expected, especially since it is coming from such a presigious institution. The main issues i found with the data provided are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing Values: Missing values is a very serious issue with this data, especiialy in tsumto_c, which had almost half the columns/features in the dataset having more than 80% missing values. This issue was the main obstacle in terms of trying to further understand Thrombosis and its relationship with the general lab tests. There could be some important relationships and patterns that were not deciphered because of this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of Thrombosis cases: This research project's main focus was understanding Thrombosis at a deeper level and uncovering patterns in the data that could serve has predictors to this disease. However, the data provided barely has any Thrombosis cases, especially more severe ones (levels 2 and 3), making any analysis very sensitive to the addition of larger number of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imbalanced Data: Dataset tsumoto_b was highly imbalanced, with almost all patients (around 85%) being females, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions that Thrombosis occurs much more frequently with females (When sampling to thrombosis + cases only is done). A proper analysis on gender could not be conducted because of this.          \n",
    "\n",
    "* Dates: There is a **huge** difference between the dates patients are testing for thrombosis and their lab tests, with some of them having more than a 5 year difference. This makes any analysis on lab results (tsumoto_c) very weak considering the patients' actual results would have been very different if they had more recent (closer to Thrombosis examination) lab tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to mention that all the data was collected between the years 1989 and 1996 where the data collection methods were not the most advanced and discrepancies in data was common in the industry. A better idea would be conducting an analysis on thrombosis using more recent data if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of main findings, they are the following (elaborated more in results.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Level 3 Thrombosis appears to happen with people on the higher end of the age distirbution.\n",
    "* ANA and aCl_igG seem to be the lab results that **could** have the most predictive power.\n",
    "* Different levels of Thrombosis are accompanied with different sets of symptoms.\n",

This might indicate that the age of a patient could have a say of the Thrombosis level they are diagnosed with, but probably is not powerful enough to conclude if a person has Thrombosis or not. In other words, if patient A has Thrombosis, age might tell us whether he has level 1, 2, or 3 Thrombosis. However, if patient A comes in to test for Thrombosis without prior knowledge if they have the disease, then their age might not be indicative of anything.\n",

    "In terms of the special lab tests conducted at the Laboratory of Collagen Diseases, Figure 2 strongly suggests that ana and acl_igg are good indicators of whether a person has Thrombosis. The plot shows that the higher a patient's degree of Thrombosis is, the higher that patient's ANA values are (on average). As for aCL IgG, it is much higher for people with Level 1 Thrombosis than all other cases, with that value dropping as the degree of severity increases. If more tests were provided in a proper dataset, maybe additional relevant features could have been found. <br><br>\n",

    "Figure 3 shows that different levels of Thrombosis are accompanied by different sets of symptoms that are prevalent for each group. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Brain infarction is the most dominant symptom for Thrombosis Level 1 patients.\n",
    "* CNS lupus is the most dominant symptom for Thrombosis Level 2 patients.\n",
    "* Throbocytopenia is the most dominant symptom for Thrombosis Level 3 patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients that come into a clinic with any of these symptoms could provide an initial guess as to which Thrombosis level they might have, however more data (with higher quality) is needed to validate this claim.\n",

    "Finally, Figure 4 indicates that only 2 of the Laboratory tests that were provided data for are possible predictors of Thrombosis, ANA and aCL IgG. This figure uses different mathematical techniques to validate what was concluded by Figure 1, which further validates the idea that there could be lab tests being carried out that have the potential to predict the possibility of a patient getting Thrombosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this research project has highlighted two crucial points. Firstly, thrombosis can potentially be predicted using routine lab tests carried out at hospitals on a daily basis. If this claim is further examined and proven true, it could save thousands of lives from this severe disease. Secondly, despite the limited and low-quality data provided, this study has improved our understanding of thrombosis, and there is clear potential for even more discoveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although my work does not provide a definitive solution for predicting or preventing thrombosis, it serves as a stepping stone towards securing proper funding, obtaining more and better quality data, and building a larger team of scientists to further explore the promising findings of this research.\n",
